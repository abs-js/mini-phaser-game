# my phaser game
This mini game uses the javascript library [phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) to be able to move the character, collect coins and power ups and win, the objective is to get to the flag as quickly as possible (located at the end level) in less time, collecting maximum coins.

## how to play:
There are several game elements:

**basic movement:** left or right movements are made by ← and →.
**jump:** you can't miss it, jump with ↑.
**coins:** one of 2 forms of scoring, can be collected by tapping them (in total the game has 50).
**power ups:** there are 3 different power ups:
    1. coin adder: adds 10 coins to your pocket.
    2. speed adder: increases speed for 3 seconds.
    3. super jump: your jump height is twice as high for 3 seconds.

**time:** there is a time counter that indicates how long it took to complete the game, it is the other form of scoring.

## tips and tricks:
Hold the jump button to jump every time you fall.
**NOTE:** this trick will be available until the second update (2.0.0.0);
